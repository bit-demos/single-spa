The Single Spa react example component demonstrates the bundling of a React component into a module configured for consumption in a single-spa application.  

To achieve that, the Single Spa React component uses a [Webpack transformer](https://bit.dev/teambit/webpack/content/configure-webpack/~compositions) that sets the target output for the bundler to [SystemJs](https://webpack.com/libraries).

Note some foibles of single-spa when building the single-spa compatible module from an app component:
1. You must define an orgName and projectName for the webpack configuration
1. You must configure some pattern for the entry file in the webpack configuration. This is the file that webpack will use to create the systemJs module for 
single-spa. Here we have configured it as `<orgName>-<projectName>`, so if your org name is `org1` and the project is `new-proj` then you will need to have a file called
`org1-newProj.ts` as your entry file
1. This entry file is where you run the single-spa magic on your component's code to create the mount, unmount and bootstrap functions that single-spa requires.
See the `teambit-singlespa-react-example.ts` file in this component for details. 
1. Once you have configured things as required (most is pre-configured for you if you fork this component) you can run `bit build` and you should then get the 
bundled output in the component's capsule, under `react-common-js/<component-name-without-namespaces>/public`;
1. You can run `serve -l <port_number>` from that directory and then use the single-spa component in a single-spa root config app to demo your output


To examine and use this Single Spa React app component, fork it to your workspace:
```bash
bit fork learnbit.apps.single-spa/react-example
```

Configure the new forked app component on your [workspace.json](https://bit.dev/teambit/workspace/content/workspace-configuration/~compositions):

```bash
bit use learnbit.apps.single-spa/react-example
```

Test the app's build by running the following:

```bash
bit build learnbit.apps.single-spa/react-example
```

Check the generated output in the app's corresponding [Capsule](https://bit.dev/teambit/component/content/capsule/~compositions) (run `bit capsule list` to get the workspace capsule root dir path).
